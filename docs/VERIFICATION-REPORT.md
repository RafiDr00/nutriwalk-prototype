## 🚀 How to Verify Yourself

### Option 1: Run Full Test Suite (Recommended)
```bash
node d:\hackathon\nutriwalk-backend\verify-all.js
```
**Expected Output:** All 27 tests pass, 100% success rate

### Option 2: Manual Browser Test
1. Open: http://localhost:3000
2. Should see: API documentation with endpoints
3. Status: success = true, version = 1.0.0

### Option 3: PowerShell Quick Check
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File d:\hackathon\nutriwalk-backend\quick-check.ps1
```

### Option 4: Test Individual Endpoints
```powershell
# Health
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:3000

# Foods
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:3000/foods

# Register (replace username)
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:3000/auth/register -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"username":"test","password":"test123456"}'

# Login
$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:3000/auth/login -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"username":"test","password":"test123456"}'
$token = $response.data.token

# Log meal (use token from above)
$headers = @{Authorization = "Bearer $token"}
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:3000/meals/logMeal -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Headers $headers -Body '{"foodName":"Apple"}'

# Get progress (use token from above)
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:3000/meals/progress -Headers $headers
```
